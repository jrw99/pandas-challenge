Repo for the pandas challenge

The HerosOfPymoli.ipynb is the final solution file that contains both the observable trends embedded at the top followed by the final code for each action item.

The HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb file is the original file to compare results against.

The HeroesOfPymoli_Work.ipynb file is where I tried things out and did my work before placing in a clean, finalized notebook.
